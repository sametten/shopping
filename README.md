This repo builded for a basic test case. Back to basics. 

#### Layout
This basic design layout as 2 columns. BEM used as a class name standard. The left column contains just background image. Right column contains all of content. Layout changed on mobile as col.

### Figure
Background position very important for left column. Background size defined as cover. Position of background defined as top and center. Because the woman's face who appeared in the photo always should be in the viewport.  And last thing about this section aspect ratio defined as "4/3".

###  Content
Important thing for content column is head. Head section overflows to image on mobile layout. For building this layout, head section aspect ratio defined same as image section and position defined as absolute.

Swiper js used for product carousel. For better back-end implementation, color options of products background color style defined as inline style.
